# library-manager
A simple GUI application to manage a library database

Technologies used: Java 8, Maven

The project is in initial stage (displays a list of books and readers, enables the user to add and delete books and readers).

I plan to add the following features soon:
  - database support (using Hibernate)
  - enable readers to borrow and return books
