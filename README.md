# library-manager
A simple GUI application to manage a library database

Technologies used:
* Java 8
* Hibernate
* H2 database (embedded)
* Maven

The project is in initial stage (displays a list of books and readers, enables the user to add and delete books and readers).

How I plan to develop the project:
* normalize the database
* fix some concurrency issues
* enable readers to borrow and return books
