# library-manager
A simple GUI application to manage a library database

Technologies used:
* Java 8
* Hibernate
* H2 database (embedded)
* Maven

Current functionality:
* Display the list of books and readers
* Display the list of books borrowed by a given reader
* Add readers and books to the database
* Remove readers and books from the database
* Borrow and return books

How I plan to develop the project:
* Enable the user to edit book and reader data
* Add transaction history for books and readers
* Normalize the database
